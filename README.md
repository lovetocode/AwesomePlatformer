# Awesome Platformer
Awesome Platformer is a game that I made from a skill share tutorial. I have not finished the first level yet. There is a boss but, I don't know how to code him. And there is a problem when I jump. If the character is standing still I can't jump but, if I move and then press the jump button the character jumps. I hope to figure out how to code the boss, and add more levels. 
I thought the boss movied but, it doesn't.
